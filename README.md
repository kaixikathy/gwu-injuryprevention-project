ChatGPT and Perplexity were used to assist with the literature review process, including identifying relevant peer-reviewed studies, synthesizing findings, drafting the Introduction, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion sections. These tools provided suggested wording, structure, and example citations; however, final content and interpretation were reviewed and edited by the researcher.
ChatGPT was also used to help determine which statistical analyses would be most appropriate for the dataset, including recommendations for descriptive visualizations (box plots, histograms), regression modeling strategies, and interpretation of outputs. In addition, ChatGPT assisted in writing explanations of variables, such as the Distressed Communities Index (DCI) rank, and guided decisions about coding in the Methods section.
Visual Studio Code was used to write, run, and test Python code for data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. The coding environment included libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and statsmodels. AI outputs were treated as guidance rather than automated execution — coding decisions were implemented manually, and all analysis results were generated directly from the dataset.
